    * Task 3: Red Light, Green Light
    *
    * The game: In Red Light, Green Light, there is a light that changes color back and forth between
    * green and red. The goal of the player is to get from start to finish, by pressing any key to move
    * their character forward. However, if the player is caught moving during red light, they will lose!
    *
    * Your task is to implement a stream that updates the current game state based on player input,
    * the state of the light, and previous game state.
    *
    * You should return a stream that is metered to update every 10 milliseconds, and concurrently runs
    * the [[lightChanger()]] stream.
    *
    * Here are the basic rules your implementation should follow:
    * - If the game is running, you should increment the player's position if the player input isn't empty.
    * - Set the player input back to None after you have done so.
    * - If the game is running and the player is moving during red light, change the game mode to Loss.
    * - If the game is running and the player position is equal to [[TrackSize]], change the game mode to Victory.
